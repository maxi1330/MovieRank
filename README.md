# Movie-Rank-app
## Search the best rated movies and series

Movie Rank is a final work of study. It is a mobile project that is updated all the time from the TMDB API. We use various technologies of the most current in development, allowing the user to be informed about the latest series and movies to watch at home or at the cinema. It is friendly, very simple to use and is designed with the elements of Material Design. Let's make a tour.
